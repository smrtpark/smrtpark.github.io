Overall look and design of Smart Park
-------------------------------------
The overall look of Smart Park is intended to be modern and elegant.
The site should be minimalist and user friendly since this app is intended to be used by different age groups and demographics.


Colours
-------
The 3 main colours used in the Smark Park website are black, white and green.
The colours are purposefully toned down in order to carry through the modern and elegant look of the website.

These are the hex values for the colours of the website:
#000000
#FFFFFF
#0E7C00

Typography
----------
We have used the Open Sans font which creates a modern feel and look for the website.

Icons
-----
The icons on our website match the modern feel of the rest of the website. 
They are simple and have a cool colour fade-in/fade-out effect when a user hovers over them. This also applies to the main logo.

Links
-----
Links are not explicitly displayed on the website; rather, they are stylishly integrated into the icons in the navbar 
and in the various buttons on the website. They also come to life when hovering over them, as they turn from white to green.

Buttons
-------
The buttons are flat, green and have a cool animation that allows them to expand when a user hovers over them.
